## User Story

1. The user can see hot videos from different categories on YouTube channel
2. The user can click the 'trending' bookmark to look for current hot videos
3. The user can search their videos from YouTube database
4. The user can view video details, comments, and related videos when they click one of the thumbnail images
5. it will load more videos/comments when the user scrolls to the bottom of the current page

### It utilizes Youtube Data API v3, the data you see is real, not mock data.

## Room for improvement

- Add a backend server to protect the YouTube API key
